# CBIR

The aim of the project is to try out different techniques to perform CBIR. For this project, I implemented sum of squared difference, and histogram intersection as distance metrics between two images. Additionally, I used different types of histograms such as RGB, RG chromaticity, magnitude texture, Gabor and Laws textures. Based on my results, texture histograms combined with color histograms work best.
